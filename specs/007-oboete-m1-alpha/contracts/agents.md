# Agent Adapter Contract (M1)

Source of truth for payload shapes: `docs/research/oboete-contracts-2026-09-02.md` plus the
verification-gate probes (research R13) appended to `docs/research/`. Versions verified: Claude
Code 2.1.258, Codex CLI 0.152.1, Grok Build 1.0.17, Pi 0.84.4 (requires Node >= 22.19).

## Normalized events (zod discriminated union)

Envelope on every event: `event` (kind, from the handler's fixed `--event` argument written by
setup, cross-checked against the payload when one is parsed), `agent` (`claude|codex|grok|pi|unknown`,
from the fixed selector below, never from the payload), `native_session_id`, `conversation_id`,
`cwd`, `captured_at`, optional `agent_id`, `agent_type` (subagents), optional `model`.

| kind | fields |
|---|---|
| session_start | `source` (`startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`, `fork`, `new`) |
| prompt | `text`, `input_source` (`user`, `rpc`, `extension`), optional `prompt_id` |
| tool_call | `tool_call_id`, `tool_name_native`, `tool_name`, `input` (redacted, size-capped) |
| tool_result | `tool_call_id`, `output` (redacted, size-capped), `is_error` |
| tool_failure | `tool_call_id`, `error` |
| turn_end | `turn_index`, `reason` |
| session_end | `reason` |
| compaction_summary | `text` |
| last_assistant_message | `text` |

Size cap (R4, A7 with the A14 bound): the hook reads at most 256 KiB from stdin and stops; the part that was read goes
through the detector and is stored as a `partial` row (`classification_state = partial`,
`truncated = 1`, kind from the `--event` argument, session id and tool paths from a bounded scan
of the read bytes for the top-level `session_id` and path fields; when no session id is
recoverable only a diagnostics counter is incremented). Partial rows stay `local_only` for life,
contribute only metadata (tool name, paths) to the rule-based summarizer, never enter a provider
request, and are never injected; the viewer shows them marked truncated. Runner tolerance of
unread stdin is an R13 probe. The 12,000-character limit applies only when a
batch input is built. Normalized tool names: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`,
`task`, `mcp:<server>/<tool>`, `other`; an agent/tool whose payload fixture (R13) does not exist
yet is stored metadata-only (`classification_state = failed`, reason `unmapped_payload`), never
as an unmapped payload. Grok `Stop` maps its verified `lastAssistantMessage` field to
`last_assistant_message`; Codex and Grok `PostCompact` map the field the R13 probe identifies.

## Agent identity (fixed selectors)

Setup writes a distinct handler command per agent, so the adapter is chosen by the command line,
never by payload heuristics:

| agent | handler written by setup | resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | `oboete hook --agent codex --event <name>` | fixed |
| Pi | `oboete capture --agent pi --event <name>`, `oboete inject --agent pi` | fixed |
| Claude Code, Grok Build | `oboete hook --agent claude-or-grok --event <name>` (Grok Build also reads Claude-compat hooks from `$HOME`) | `GROK_HOOK_EVENT` or `GROK_SESSION_ID` present → grok; else claude |

An invocation without `--agent` is stored as `unknown` and reported by doctor; payload shape is
used only to label it for diagnosis.

## Event identity and conversation identity

`raw_events.id` uses the most specific stable key available (R7), and every form includes the
event kind: tool events use (kind, `tool_call_id`), so a `tool_call` and its `tool_result` never
share an id; prompts use (kind, `prompt_id`) where the agent supplies one; everything else uses
(turn ordinal, kind, content hash). No per-delivery counter is used. The turn ordinal comes from
`sessions.turn_count`, the one database read the hook makes before computing the id; on the spool
path that read is unavailable, so the entry keeps the ordinal-less id and recovery replays it as
stored. Accepted limits: two byte-identical events of the last form inside one turn collapse to
one row; a repeated identical prompt in a later turn does not; a re-delivered prompt that carries
no `prompt_id` opens the next turn and gets a second row (collapsing two identical prompts of one
session would be the more frequent loss).

`conversation_id` is the oboete id of the root session. Claude Code `resume` (same `session_id`),
Codex `resume`, Pi `resume` (`PI_SESSION_ID` continues and `session_start.reason` stays `startup`,
so resume is detected by id continuity, R13 probe 2026-09-03), and Grok Build resume
(`SessionStart.source = "load"`, same `sessionId`, `transcriptPath` present; `--fork-session` gives a
new id with `source = "load"`, R13 probe 2026-09-03) keep the root; `fork` and Grok `new` start a
new root. Codex fires its `SessionStart` hooks lazily, at the start of the next turn rather than at
the event itself (isolated-user measurements 2026-09-05, codex-cli 0.153.0): after a TUI `/compact`,
`PostCompact` fires at once and `SessionStart source = compact` about 200 ms before the next turn's
`UserPromptSubmit` (04:01:27.744Z, 04:01:30.180Z, 04:01:30.375Z); after `/new`, the parent gets no
`SessionEnd` (it arrives at `/quit`) and the new session's `SessionStart source = startup` fires
about 200 ms before its first `UserPromptSubmit` (06:08:25.536Z, 06:08:25.734Z, run
2026-09-05T06-02-58-033Z). A session quit before its next turn therefore shows neither hook, which
is what the Phase 1 probe D (A18) and the lifecycle run 2026-09-05T03-30-44-818Z recorded as "no
SessionStart". As a fallback the session-start pack of an epoch is also delivered on the first
`UserPromptSubmit` that finds no session-start injection for the conversation's current
`context_epoch` (A21): that covers a spooled SessionStart and any CLI build that skips the lazy
hook, with one rule.

## Capture and injection per agent

| Agent | Capture events | Injection channel and policy | Cap | Setup writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure → `tool_failure`, Stop → `last_assistant_message` (and `turn_end`), PostCompact → `compaction_summary`, SessionEnd (capture only, 1.5 s shared budget) | plain stdout on SessionStart when `source` is `startup`, `clear`, or `compact`; nothing on `resume` or `fork` (transcript replay); plain stdout on UserPromptSubmit | 10,000 characters per value | oboete-owned handlers (`"oboete": true`) merged into `~/.claude/settings.json`; timeouts 12 s on injection hooks, 3 s on capture hooks; `claude mcp add oboete --scope user -- "<node>" "<bundle>" mcp` (removal names the same scope) |
| Codex CLI | SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, PostCompact (no summary field: keys `session_id`, `turn_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`, `model`, `trigger`; `compaction_summary` absent by contract, R13 probe 2026-09-03), SessionEnd (1 s default, capture only) | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on SessionStart with matcher `startup\|clear\|compact` (verified enum; `resume` excluded; `clear` never observed on `/new`, A18) and on UserPromptSubmit, which also carries the session-start pack whenever the current epoch has none yet (A21 fallback; the SessionStart of `/new` and of a compaction fires lazily at the next turn, A18/A21); `additionalContextLimit = 0` | provider context, no spill | `~/.codex/hooks.json` handlers; managed block in `~/.codex/config.toml` with `[hooks.state."<abs path>:<event>:<group>:<handler>"] trusted_hash = "sha256:<hex of canonical handler json>"` and `[mcp_servers.oboete]` |
| Grok Build | SessionStart (`source: "new"` when headless, `"load"` on resume and fork), UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse (a failed shell call arrives here with `exit_code`, not as PostToolUseFailure), PostToolUseFailure, PermissionDenied (fires only for a permission-rule deny, never for a hook deny; keys `hookEventName`, `sessionId`, `cwd`, `workspaceRoot`, `timestamp`, `transcriptPath`, `permissionMode`, `toolName`, `toolUseId`, `toolInput`, `toolInputTruncated`; no reason field), Stop (`reason: end_turn` only) → `last_assistant_message` from the verified `lastAssistantMessage` field, PostCompact (no summary field; `timestamp` is the per-compaction key; `compaction_summary` absent by contract, R13 probe 2026-09-03), SessionEnd | FR-045 state machine below | 10,000 characters (silent clip) | `~/.grok/hooks/oboete.json` with explicit `timeout` per hook (12 s injection, 3 s capture); handlers deduplicated against the Claude compat layer; MCP registration verified 2026-09-03 (`[mcp_servers.oboete]` in `~/.grok/config.toml` or `grok mcp add --scope user`; the tool name seen by hooks is `oboete__<tool>`) |
| Pi | `session_start` (from `session_start`), `input` (source filter), `tool_result` (input + content + isError), `agent_settled` → `turn_end` + `last_assistant_message` when available, `session_shutdown` (reason `quit|reload|new|resume|fork`), `session_compact` (`compactionEntry.id` is the per-compaction key; `session_before_compact` precedes it; R13 probe 2026-09-03) | `before_agent_start` returns the pack produced by a bounded child `oboete inject` (`AbortSignal.timeout`: 1.3 s at session start while a summary is pending, 300 ms otherwise); capture through a detached child `oboete capture --invocation <id>` that writes a two-phase acknowledgement (`<invocation>.started` before reading stdin → `.done`); the extension itself only try/catches, generates invocation ids, spawns, and counts failures in memory (message code only), handing the counters to the next child it spawns as `--prior-failures`; no in-process file or network write (FR-007; recording guarantee per amendment A8 and the R13 Pi error-surface probe) | provider context | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/oboete.js` loader importing `piExtension` from the bundle; tools call `oboete search\|timeline\|get --json` as child processes |

### Grok Build deferred delivery (FR-045)

Definitions: a pack is **planned** when it is built and its items are recorded `planned`; it is
**delivered** when the model has received it, and only then are its items `included` and its
memories counted for the conversation.

1. At SessionStart or UserPromptSubmit the pack is built and stored `pending`. If a `pending`
   record already exists for the conversation (no tool call happened since), the new pack merges
   into it: existing `planned` items stay, new items are added under the same budget, and the
   record gets a new `pack_hash`. One pending record per conversation at any time.
2. On every `PreToolUse` of the turn while the record is not yet `emitted`, the hook emits the
   pending pack as `additionalContext` and appends `{ tool_call_id, execution: pending,
   delivery: pending, at }` to `injections.attempts_json`. Grok delivers it with the results of
   the batch once the call has run (verified wording); a denied call never runs and delivers nothing. Attaching on
   every call until confirmation is what makes "the first call that actually runs" (FR-045) hold
   whatever the order of denies and executions inside a parallel batch; the price is that two
   calls of one parallel batch may both carry the pack. Whether Grok delivers `additionalContext`
   once per batch or once per call is the R13 probe: once per batch → no duplication exists and
   nothing more is needed; once per call → the Grok lane is **blocked** until the owner decides
   A15 (accept per-call duplication inside one parallel batch, with its effect on FR-026, User
   Story 1 scenario 2, SC-010, FR-028, and Principle IV's injection volume stated in the
   amendment) or removes parallel-batch delivery from M1. In either case every attempt's `execution` and
   `delivery` fields are persisted in `injections.attempts_json` (vocabulary and update rules in
   `data-model.md`) so `why` reports actual deliveries per attempt after the raw events have
   expired, and the E2E counts them.
3. On `PostToolUse` for any attempted `tool_call_id` that attempt becomes `execution = ran`,
   `delivery = delivered` (and on `PostToolUseFailure`, `execution = failed` with delivery
   `delivered` if the R13 probe shows the context survives a failed call); the first `delivered`
   attempt makes the record `emitted` and its items `included`. On `PostToolUse` with a `pending` record and no attempted id (oboete's own
   `PreToolUse` handler did not complete: timeout or crash) the hook emits the pack from
   `PostToolUse` and marks it `emitted` the same way.
4. A denied call produces no `PostToolUse`, and the next `PreToolUse` attaches the pack again
   (step 2). `PermissionDenied` (payload per R13 probe) marks that attempt `execution = denied`,
   `delivery = dropped`; `PostToolUseFailure` marks it `failed` with delivery `delivered` or
   `dropped` per the probe; `Stop` marks every pending attempt `dropped`. Execution and delivery
   are separate fields of `injections.attempts_json`.
5. At `Stop` (`end_turn`) a record still `pending` or `attempted` becomes `omitted` with reason
   `no_tool_call` when oboete observed no tool hook of any kind in the turn, otherwise
   `not_delivered` (a deny by an earlier handler stops the chain before oboete runs, so "all
   denied" is not distinguishable and is not claimed); a degraded reason the pack was built with
   (`window_unknown` for Grok, which reports no model) is the more specific one and stays on the
   record (FR-028), so the omission cause is then read from the items; its items become `omitted` /
   `not_delivered`, so the memories remain injectable in the next turn. Tests count the packs the
   model received in the success, execution-failure, oboete-deny, other-handler-deny, parallel
   batch, and no-tool cases.

## Injection policy shared by all agents

Same repository only (FR-044); never the same memory twice in one conversation (FR-026, counted
on delivery); the session-start pack is emitted at most once per context epoch (an epoch starts at the root
session and advances once per compaction, A12; the authoritative compaction event is one per
agent: `PostCompact` on Claude Code (carries `compact_summary`), Codex, and Grok Build, and the
`session_compact` event on Pi; the companion `SessionStart source = compact`
never advances the epoch and only reads it, except on Claude Code (A16, 2026-09-03), where that hook
runs about 24 ms before `PostCompact` and therefore opens the epoch itself, `PostCompact` only
confirming it. The epoch key is the native per-compaction value where the R13 probe found one
(Grok Build `PostCompact.timestamp`, Pi `compactionEntry.id`) and the `PostCompact` event id on
Claude Code and Codex (A16 default: byte-identical same-turn compactions collapse)), which gives FR-024's "not again on resume" and its
re-injection after compaction on every agent; session start
= latest session summary + pinned memories, bounded to the channel cap, pinned trimmed in pin
order; prompt submit = the memories an index matches, in relevance order, up to a character
budget = min(channel cap, `context_fraction` × context window), `context_fraction` default 0.05.
Admission is the match itself, not a score cut (#275); only redundancy and the budget remove a
matched memory.
The context window is the documented window of the reported `model` from
`docs/research/context-windows.md` (R12, maintained under R13); when the model is unknown or
absent, the budget uses the smallest verified window for that agent and the pack carries
`Degraded: window_unknown`; an agent with no verified window at all is blocked by the R13 gate
(no injection lane ships for it until a window is verified or the owner decides). Tokens convert at 4 characters per token for English and 1.5 for CJK.
Every pack builder runs the same staleness check (paths via `fs.existsSync`; commits via the
worker's `HEAD`-keyed cache) and records the outcome. Retrieval reads memories only, from applied
or fallback batches, never `secret` rows or rows with `classification_state = failed`, so another
session's unfinished turn and verbatim tool output are never injected.

## Pack format (all agents)

```text
oboete memory context
> repository: <normalized identity, userinfo removed>
> session summary (<relative time>):
> <text, one line per paragraph>
> pinned: <title>
> <body>
> related: <title> [<path or commit>; <stale note>]
> <body>
> degraded: <plain-language sentence>   (only when applicable)
end of oboete memory context
```

The first and last lines are the only unprefixed lines and are labels, not instructions; every
other line, including repository identity, titles, citations, and bodies, is prefixed with `> `
as data framing, and every external string is canonicalized to a single line first (newlines and
control characters removed), so no title, path, or remote can produce an unprefixed line. The
pack never starts with `{`; bodies are summarizer output or fallback records, never verbatim tool
output; the producing agent is not named in the pack. The `degraded:` line is a plain-language sentence mapped from the reason code (for example
`daily_cap` → "Today's free summary quota is used up, so these are rule-based notes."); the code
itself stays in the ledger, `why`, and doctor. The finished pack is validated as a whole
(secret detector, directive corpus, control characters) before it is emitted; a directive-corpus
test (`test/corpus/directives.jsonl`) plus malicious title, path, and remote-URL cases assert
that nothing escapes the framing (the directive phrases legitimately exist in raw events and the
spool).

## Hook process rules and SLAs

- Always exit `0`; never print anything but the pack to stdout; log to `~/.oboete/logs/hook.log`.
- Every hook has an absolute deadline measured from process start. Capture hooks (`PreToolUse`,
  `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `Stop`, `PostCompact`, `SessionEnd`, Pi capture child):
  300 ms. The budget is allocated in order: a spool reserve of 40 ms is held back
  first; the detector runs in a `worker_threads` Worker that the main thread terminates at a
  hard cutoff (deadline minus the spool reserve minus a 20 ms row-build margin); a terminated
  detector yields a metadata-only row (`classification_state = failed`, reason `deadline`),
  never unsanitized content. Each lock wait on a capture connection is capped at 150 ms
  and every wait ends by a deadline fixed when the connection is opened (the remaining
  budget minus the spool reserve); time spent between waits counts against that
  deadline. SQLite's own busy timeout is not used on hook-budget connections because
  it bounds requested sleep rather than elapsed time. When the remaining budget after the
  detector is below the reserve the database is not opened and the sanitized event goes
  straight to the spool; a storage failure after the detector → spool. A wall-time test
  combines a slow detector with a busy database. The full detector must finish the read
  bound inside the cutoff on Node 22.16 (R13 probe); if it cannot, no smaller bound is
  introduced silently: the capture lane is blocked and the measured bound goes to the
  owner as A14. Measured on 2026-09-04: a secret-dense 1 MB payload takes 406-665 ms, above
  the 240 ms cutoff, so A14 set the read bound to 256 KiB, which keeps that worst case near
  100-170 ms. Tests assert process wall time per event kind (worst-case input at the
  read bound and a detector that never returns) and 100% in-deadline exits under every
  fault; the replay p99 is an additional SC-002 measurement, not the guarantee.
- Injection hooks (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, Grok delivery hooks, Pi inject child):
  300 ms when the previous summary is ready; at session start only, the hook additionally waits
  up to 1 s while it is pending (1.3 s wall in total, `INJECTION_DEADLINE_MS`; the wait is capped
  at the remaining budget), then injects the latest raw activity labelled `summary pending`.
- The detector (stdin cap, private strip, path rules, secretlint core + gated entropy) runs before
  the first write anywhere, including the spool.
- The paused marker is checked before the database is opened.
