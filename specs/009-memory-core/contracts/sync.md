# Device sync contract (US6, T033)

Status: contract only. No code, dependency, schema, network call or real transfer exists for it.
Owner decisions of 2026-09-11 fix the shape: encrypted bundle files in a directory the user
chooses (any file-sync tool moves them), Node `crypto` only, no new dependency, no cloud object
store in 009. Cloudflare R2 remains a later transport behind the same envelope; `research.md` R8
keeps the earlier R2 findings for that day.

Sync moves the user's own knowledge between the user's own installations. It is not sharing with
other people, not a backup of the whole database and not a migration: live quarantined text and
unprocessed captures are not exported, an approval never travels as authority over content it did
not approve, and the migration merger (`transfer-merge.ts`) is never used to apply sync input.

## Fence

- Nothing runs unless a sync space is configured, its consent tuple matches and a human runs
  `oboete sync push` or `oboete sync pull`. No hook, capture, injection, observer worker, doctor or
  MCP path imports the sync transport (`src/sync/space.ts` and what it pulls in) or performs sync
  I/O; `doctor` and MCP read only `src/sync/status.ts`, which queries `config.toml` and the local
  tables. There is no background scheduler in 009.
- Sync performs no network operation. The only I/O is file I/O below one directory the user named.
- Text of a secret memory never leaves the machine (native export rule). Unprocessed captures and
  live quarantined rows are not exported; see "What a replica publishes".
- Encryption authenticates bundles; it never grants authority. Every pulled record passes the same
  field validation as a native import before any row changes, and no pulled record can approve a
  proposal, widen visibility, lower sensitivity or undelete a tombstone.
- Clock values in bundles are display metadata. Nothing is ordered or resolved by them.

## Sync space, replicas and keys

- **Sync space**: one directory the user owns, `<dir>/oboete-sync/v1/<space_id>/`. `space_id` is
  `hex32` random, created once by `oboete sync init <dir>`. A device joins an existing space with
  `oboete sync join <dir>`, which prompts for the key on a TTY with echo off. The key is never
  accepted as a command-line argument, environment variable or file path, so it never appears in
  shell history, `ps` output or logs.
- **Replica identity**: the installation's `replica_identity.origin_id` (0007). It names the
  replica's own bundle file and namespaces every origin ID it creates. Never derived from path,
  host, account or clock.
- **Space key**: 32 random bytes from `crypto.randomBytes`. Stored only in
  `$OBOETE_HOME/sync/<space_id>.key` (file mode `0600`, directory `0700`), never in SQLite,
  `config.toml`, logs, doctor output or bundles. `oboete sync key show` prints the one line
  `oboete-sync-key/1:<space_id>:<base64url key>` for the user to carry to the next device over a
  channel they trust; it is the only command that prints it and it requires a TTY.
- **Key id**: `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = space key, salt = "", info = "oboete-sync-key-id/1", 8 bytes)`,
  hex. A bundle whose key id differs from the local one is reported as `key_mismatch` before any
  decryption is attempted; that is a diagnostic ("another space's key, or a modified prefix"), not
  proof of either, and such a bundle is skipped like any rejected one. The id is safe to store in
  config and bundles.
- Key rotation is a new space. There is no re-encryption in place and no per-device recipient
  list; a lost or leaked key means the user creates a new space and re-pushes from a trusted device.
- `config.toml` stores: directory (as given and as `realpath` at consent time), `space_id`,
  `key_id`, selected sensitivity classes. Nothing else. `key_id` is a public HKDF output, so the
  credential guard of `oboete config` allow-lists `sync.key_id` (`KNOWN_KEY_PATHS`).

## Bundle envelope: `oboete-sync-bundle/1`

One bundle per replica per space: `<space dir>/<replica origin_id>.osb`. A replica writes only its
own file, always as a whole: write `<name>.osb.tmp-<random>`, `fsync`, rename over `<name>.osb`.
Because no two replicas ever write the same file, a file-sync tool has nothing to merge and never
produces a "conflicted copy" of a bundle that Oboete would read. Readers accept only names of the
exact form `<hex32>.osb`; any other file in the directory is ignored.

Binary layout, all big-endian:

| Offset | Bytes | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 20 | Magic `oboete-sync-bundle/1` (ASCII, no terminator). |
| 20 | 8 | Key id (see above). |
| 28 | 16 | Bundle salt from `crypto.randomBytes`. |
| 44 | … | Chunks. |

Chunk keys: `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = space key, salt = bundle salt, info = "oboete-sync-bundle/1",
32 bytes)`. Chunks are AES-256-GCM (`crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', …, { authTagLength: 16 })`),
in order, each followed by its 16-byte tag. Framing is fixed-width, the age payload rule: every
non-final chunk encrypts exactly 65,536 plaintext bytes (65,552 bytes on disk); the final chunk
encrypts 1 to 65,536 bytes, or 0 bytes only when the whole plaintext is empty. The reader needs no
length field: while more than 65,552 bytes remain after the prefix it consumes one non-final
chunk; the last 16 to 65,552 bytes are the final chunk (a stream reader confirms end-of-file by
lookahead before treating a full-size unit as final). The 12-byte nonce is an 11-byte big-endian
chunk counter starting at 0 followed by one byte that is `0x01` for the final chunk and `0x00`
otherwise. Every chunk sets the 44-byte prefix as AAD. A missing final chunk, a non-final chunk
shorter than 65,536 bytes, a counter gap, a remainder shorter than 16 bytes or a tag failure
rejects the whole bundle; nothing partial is ever applied.

Bounds follow from the framing. Total plaintext (header line plus every record line) is at most
256 MiB (268,435,456 bytes), so a file is at most `44 + plaintext + 16 × ceil(plaintext / 65,536)`
= 268,501,036 bytes; a larger file is rejected by `stat` before it is opened for reading. The
header line is at most 65,536 bytes.

## Plaintext: header and revision log

The plaintext is JSONL: one header line, then revision lines. There is no separate native body;
each revision carries its own payload, so multiple heads of one origin, control revisions without
content and history without content are all the same line shape. Field validation of a payload
reuses the native v2 record schemas (`transfer-format.ts`, one schema per kind); reference rules
are sync's own and are stated below.

Header (`oboete-sync-snapshot/1`), fixed-size fields only:

```json
{"format":"oboete-sync-snapshot/1","space_id":"…","replica_origin_id":"…","snapshot_id":"…","revision_lines":42,"heads":7,"revisions_sha256":"…","withheld":{"works":0,"memories":0,"sources":0,"contexts":0,"proposals":0},"produced_at":1760000000}
```

- `replica_origin_id` must equal the file name's `hex32`; `space_id` must equal the directory's.
- `revision_lines` bounds the rest of the plaintext before parsing (line count and total bytes
  are both checked); `revisions_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the exact bytes of every body line
  (`repo` lines and revision lines, each with its trailing newline, in file order) and must match
  the bytes actually read. Everything is inside the ciphertext, so all of it is
  authenticated.
- `snapshot_id` = SHA-256 over canonical JSON `["oboete-sync-snapshot/1", space_id,
  replica_origin_id, revisions_sha256]`: it identifies the exact delivery (which revisions, which
  of them are heads, which payloads are shipped), so a consent change that ships more payloads, a
  `--republish` after a mapping, or a newly held payload all produce a new snapshot, while an
  unchanged state produces the same ID because lines are canonical and heads are recomputed
  deterministically. Every bundle's ciphertext still differs. `heads` is the count of lines
  flagged `head` and must match.
- `withheld` counts what "What a replica publishes" left out.

Revision line (`oboete-sync-revision/1`):

```json
{"origin_id":"<hex32>:<kind-local id>","kind":"memory","revision_id":"<hex64>","author":"<hex32>","parents":["<hex64>"],"control":{"tombstone":false,"sensitivity_floor":"local_only"},"natural":{"repo":"<repo key>","content_hash":"<hex64>"},"payload_hash":"<hex64>|null","head":true,"payload":{…}|null}
```

Identity fields are `origin_id`, `kind`, `revision_id`, `author`, `parents`, `control`,
`natural`, `payload_hash`; they are immutable once created and are what a reader stores. `head`
and `payload` are delivery fields, recomputed by every publisher; a source head line that ships
no payload because its row is deleted or secret carries a third one, `tuple` (the UNIQUE-tuple
members of `memory_sources` as the revision's payload holds them, or its parent's for a
control-only revision, references in origin form; every revision keeps its own, so a stale
snapshot pulled back never rewinds it), so a reader that captured the same citation on its own
still finds the row the control applies to. `natural` is the record's
identity in the terms the store already uses to recognize the same record from a different
source, so a reader can alias a control-only revision onto a row it already holds under another
origin. It never contains a local id or a sender-side hash that embeds one: memory
`{domain: "ordinary", repo: <repo key>, material_hash}` (the reader recomputes
`contentHash(local repo id, material_hash)` after mapping, which is how migration recognizes the
same material) or `{domain: "personal_projection", projection_hash}` (repository-independent, as
`memories.content_hash` is globally unique and personal hashes carry no repository) or, for a
checkpoint, `{domain: "checkpoint", repo, work: <work origin>, parent: <memory origin or null>,
material_hash}`; source `{memory: <memory origin>, key: <the row's sync key, see below>}`;
visibility `{memory: <memory origin>, audience, repo, work: <work origin or null>}`
(the scope tuple `memory_visibility` enforces UNIQUE, so a migration-created `v_migration:…` grant
and a `v_<hash>` grant with the same scope are one grant); sharing_proposal `{candidate:
<candidate identity hash>, origin_memory: <origin>}`; context `{repo, local_key}`; work
`{work_id}`.

- `origin_id` is `<creating replica origin_id>:<local identifier>`; only the creating replica
  allocates one, but any replica may create later revisions (successors) of any origin it knows.
  Kinds: `memory`, `source`, `visibility`, `sharing_proposal`, `work`, `context`. For a `source`
  the local identifier is `source:<sync key>`: the key is stored on the row
  (`memory_sources.sync_key`, 0008) at its first capture and never recomputed, so an in-place
  field change and a redaction are revisions of the same origin (`memory_sources.id` is a
  reusable rowid and is never used). The key is the SHA-256 of the row's wire fields (references
  in origin form) and its memory's material, with an ordinal for an identical duplicate under
  the same memory, so an identical row takes the same key: a row this device deletes and inserts
  again finds its origin (the observer rewrites flat provenance rows on every batch and records
  nothing), and the same row captured independently on another device aliases by natural key
  (the key under the memory the natural key names). A row moved under another memory is a new
  source (the natural key names the memory a source belongs to). Sameness beyond that comes
  from the UNIQUE tuples of `memory_sources`: a received head whose tuple a local row of another
  origin holds is that row's source (the two origins alias there and the row keeps its own key;
  a bound origin always names its row by the row's key); an origin without a row binds late by
  the tuple of its heads (each revision keeps the tuple of its payload, a control revision its
  parent's; a terminal head line carries it, so a deletion reaches an independently captured row
  whatever the pull order, and every local row holding a part of it) or by lineage (a revision
  of it is a parent or a child of a revision of an origin bound here; two origins already bound
  to two rows join on one, the log said they are one source). Rows that share no tuple stay
  distinct, however alike; a row of another memory holding the same key is another source, so a
  tombstone of an origin that has no row here deletes nothing. For the other kinds the local identifier is the row's
  own id. Repositories are not revisioned: a `repo` line has only
  `kind`, `origin_id` and its identity fields, and a bundle carries every repo line its payloads
  reference (see "Repository identity").
- `revision_id` = SHA-256 over canonical JSON `["oboete-record-revision/1", origin_id, kind,
  author, sorted parents, control, natural, payload_hash]`. Parent order and member order cannot
  change it.
  `payload_hash` is the SHA-256 of the canonical payload (with references already in origin form)
  or null for a control-only revision. Because the id covers the hash and not the bytes, a
  publisher may ship the line with `payload: null` when the current content filter withholds the
  text, and a reader still verifies the identity; a shipped payload must hash to `payload_hash`.
- Payload references come in two classes, exactly as the native v2 appendix and
  `referencesValid` distinguish them. Entity references are origin IDs or repo keys and must
  resolve, per kind: memory `repo_id`, `work_id`, `checkpoint_parent_id`, `superseded_by`; source
  `memory_id`, `source_memory_id`, `source_context_id`; visibility `memory_id`, `repo_id`,
  `work_id`, `proposal_id`; sharing_proposal `origin_memory_id`, `origin_repo_id`,
  `origin_work_id`, `projected_memory_id`; context `repo_id`; work `repo_id`, `origin_context_id`,
  `current_checkpoint_memory_id`. This one list drives origin conversion on push, the reference
  closure, and the ownership check on apply. Provenance identifiers (`raw_event_id`,
  `source_session_id`, `source_batch_id`, `purpose_source_event_id`, capture roots, source paths
  and the other foreign IDs the appendix lists as carrying no local authority) are kept verbatim
  as metadata and are never resolved to local rows. A reader maps entity references through
  `sync_origins` (0008: `origin_id` ↔ kind, local id) and allocates a local id for a new origin.
- `control` travels on every revision: `tombstone` (the origin is deleted; text empty) and
  `sensitivity_floor` (the lowest sensitivity a reader may hold the origin at). A control-only
  revision (`payload_hash: null`) references nothing, so it is valid and applicable whatever else
  the bundle withholds.
- Every `parents` entry must name a line in the same bundle or a revision the reader already
  stores, of the same `kind` (of the same origin, or of another origin the writer had aliased to
  the same row, see "Merge rules"); a reference to neither, a duplicate parent, a
  self-parent or a duplicate `revision_id` line rejects the bundle. A cycle cannot be built
  (ids are hashes of parents), so validation is one pass plus a bounded ancestor walk in a
  private scratch SQLite exactly as the native reader stages input.
- `head: true` marks a current head as the publisher computes it at push time; a reader recomputes
  heads from the graph it stores and never trusts the flag for anything but the `snapshot_id`
  check. An origin may have several heads (unresolved siblings), and every head is shipped with
  its payload when the filter allows, so a third replica reading only this bundle sees the same
  conflict.
- Received identity fields are stored verbatim in `sync_revisions` (0008) and re-published
  verbatim with the same `revision_id`. Payload bytes are stored when received and erased locally
  (set to null for every revision of that origin) as soon as a `secret` floor or a tombstone is
  stored for the origin; an erased payload is never re-published. Local effective state (selected
  head, quarantine, local approval record, conflict rows) lives in local tables and is never
  derived back into a foreign revision.

## Merge rules

- Identity: the origin ID, aliased onto local rows by `natural`. When a pulled revision's
  `natural` key (for a memory: repository and `content_hash`, which `memories.content_hash`
  already enforces UNIQUE per repository) equals an existing local row created under a different
  origin (two devices captured the same material independently), `sync_origins` maps the new
  origin to that row instead of inserting: one local row, several origins. A row has one head set
  (the union across its origins), one selected head, one conflict report and one
  `materialized_hash`, all kept on its canonical origin (the smallest origin ID mapped to it); a
  local change or a `resolve` creates one revision under the canonical origin, and its parents
  may be revisions of any origin aliased to the row. A reader stores a parent link to another
  origin as received; the link counts for the head set only once both origins map to one local
  row here (by `natural`, or by a repository mapping that makes two `common_dir` keys one
  repository), and until then each row keeps its own heads. Because `natural` travels on control-only revisions
  too, a deletion or secret floor for material this replica created under its own origin aliases
  and applies even when the
  other origin was never seen with a payload. Control from any aliased origin applies to the row
  (a tombstone or floor stored under either origin deletes or raises it); a live payload under one
  origin never undeletes a row tombstoned under another. A later alias onto a row that is already
  terminal inherits that terminal state.
- A revision already stored changes nothing in the graph; if it arrives with a payload the reader
  stored as null (withheld at the time) and the origin has no stored `secret` floor or tombstone,
  the validated payload is stored. Storing a payload never re-applies a revision: the effective
  row is always re-evaluated from the selected head, the stored control and the approval record,
  so a late payload for a superseded ancestor changes nothing visible.
  `oboete sync map-repo` re-evaluates stored revisions that were `withheld_on_apply` without any
  new pull.
- Heads: storing revision R removes from the row's head set every head that is an ancestor of
  R and adds R. If R removed nothing (it descends from no current head) it is a sibling: the row
  is reported in `sync_conflicts` (one row per local row, `id = 'sync:' || canonical origin ID`,
  `status = 'open'`, the head set with each head's origin in the state JSON, `content_hash` when
  it applies). Heads that R neither removed nor descends from stay heads. Rows that
  `observer/checkpoint.ts` wrote before or between syncs keep their own ids; `sync status` lists
  them with the sync rows, and a `resolve` of a work row also marks `resolved` every open
  observer row whose JSON names that work.
- Selected head: the effective row follows one head per local row. It moves to R only when R
  descends from the previously selected head (a local change or a remote descendant of the local
  line); a fresh row selects its first head; ties are never broken by time. A human moves it
  with `oboete sync resolve`.
- A local change to a row creates a revision authored by this replica whose single parent is
  the revision the row was last materialized from (`materialized_revision`, the selected head
  whose payload was applied or written here); when the selected head moved to a revision whose
  payload was withheld, the local change is a sibling of it, so a conflict reports what the
  device could not see rather than silently superseding it. Unresolved siblings stay
  unresolved. Only `oboete sync resolve` creates a revision with more than one parent, and it
  lists every current head as a parent; two exceptions for sources, whose rows are provenance
  a person never edits by hand: the siblings of a source row resolve at once, on the device
  that sees them, to the selected head (a multi-parent successor under the canonical origin,
  which also carries the alias that joined them to every other device), and the first revision
  of a source re-created under a tuple whose earlier rows this device deleted names those
  rows' tombstones as parents, so the re-creation supersedes the deletions wherever both arrive.
- Resolution: a revision with more than one parent whose parents include every current head of
  the row is applied as the resolution wherever it arrives: it becomes the single head and the
  selected head, its payload (for a work, including `current_checkpoint_memory_id`) applies
  without the checkpoint-parent chain check below, and the conflict report closes. Its
  single-parent descendants follow the ordinary rules with it as their base. A multi-parent
  revision that misses a head this replica holds (a sibling arrived after the resolver's pull)
  is one more sibling, and the conflict stays open. A single-parent revision is never a
  resolution, whatever the head set.
- Local change capture: nothing outside sync is instrumented (no triggers, no marks; the hook and
  worker are untouched). `sync_origins` records, for every local row ever materialized here (on
  its canonical origin), the canonical state the replica last wrote or applied for it
  (`materialized_hash`: payload hash plus the control the row implies) and the revision it came
  from (`materialized_revision`). An apply writes it from
  the state the applied revision implies plus the corrections that are not changes of content or
  control (a pulled approval held as `pending` without a local approval record, id mapping); a
  deletion or raise the apply itself performs (lineage inheritance, the checkpoint sweep below,
  the 0005 trigger) is not folded in, so the closing pass sees the row differ and records the
  control revision. Push and pull both begin, inside
  the writer lock and before anything else, with one pass that walks `sync_origins` and the
  tracked tables together: a row whose current canonical state differs from `materialized_hash`
  becomes a new revision authored by this replica (whether a command, the worker, the 0005
  cascade or a pull's own apply caused it); an origin whose row no longer exists (sources and
  grants are physically deleted by `observer/provenance.ts` and `worker/imported.ts`) becomes a
  tombstone revision, distinct from an origin that was never materialized (`withheld_on_apply`);
  a row with no origin yet gets one. Comparing against the materialized state, not the wire
  payload, is what keeps an apply-time correction from being mistaken for a user change. The pass
  is a scan bounded by the store and runs only in these two manual commands. A completed
  work is thus a head before any remote descendant of the older head is compared against it; a
  push restart after a `data_version` mismatch repeats the pass, so a deletion or secret marking
  that landed during staging becomes its control revision before the bundle is rebuilt; a raise
  the 0005 trigger applied to a descendant during a pull is captured at the end of that same pull
  (the pass runs again before commit) and shipped by the next push. A change-free A→B→A round
  trip records nothing, because an applied revision leaves the row exactly at the state its
  payload hash and control describe.
- `control.tombstone` dominates: once any stored revision of an origin carries it, the effective
  row is deleted and no later live payload undeletes it (a live revision that descends from the
  tombstone is a conflict, not a resurrection). A source is the exception, because its rows are
  physically deleted and re-created: its deletion holds while a head carries it, and a later
  revision of the row (an identical row inserted again, a re-creation that names the tombstone
  as parent) revives it; a live sibling of the tombstone still loses to it. Absence of an origin
  from a bundle never means deletion. For checkpoints the deletion unit is what `contracts/checkpoint.md` deletes: a
  tombstone stored for any checkpoint of a mapped work with a given `material_hash` applies to
  every checkpoint of that work and material, already stored or arriving later, whatever its
  parent or origin. Storing such a tombstone deletes every stored checkpoint row of that work
  with that `material_hash` in the same transaction (the 0005 trigger only reaches rows that
  existed on the deleting device, so a peer sweeps the set itself; the closing pass then records
  a tombstone revision for each swept row), and the apply checks stored tombstones by
  `{work, material_hash}` before creating a checkpoint row, so the outcome does not depend on
  the order bundles are read.
- `control.sensitivity_floor` merges by rank upward only, exactly as migration does
  (`SENSITIVITY_RANK`; the raise cascades to local descendants through the 0005 trigger). The
  effective sensitivity of an origin is the maximum of its local value and every stored floor. A
  floor of `secret` also drops local text.
- Lineage inheritance on apply is the migration merge's guarantee restated for sync
  (`transfer-merge.ts` `raiseToParents`): a memory or source applied under a parent
  (`source_memory_id`, `checkpoint_parent_id`) whose effective sensitivity, stored floor or
  aliased row is stricter is raised to that rank in the same transaction, its text dropped when
  the rank is `secret`, whether the parent arrived in this bundle, was already stored, or was
  raised earlier by the trigger (the AFTER UPDATE trigger does not fire for a child that arrives
  after the parent's raise, so the apply walks the lineage itself). Every raise the apply or the
  trigger causes is recorded as a control revision of the raised origin before commit (see
  "Local change capture"), so the next push carries it.
- Work checkpoints keep their existing rule for arriving revisions: a pulled checkpoint whose
  parent is not the current local checkpoint of that work is a sibling head of the work origin,
  not a replacement, and it is reported through the work row's `sync:` conflict row (see
  "Heads"; the row names the checkpoint memory IDs, and the observer's own rows for that work
  are listed beside it). `oboete sync resolve` on a work origin sets, in one transaction, the
  selected head, the work's `current_checkpoint_memory_id` to the kept head's checkpoint, and the
  conflict row to resolved; the checkpoint-parent rule is not re-applied to a human resolution.
- Visibility grants and proposal decisions arrive as revisions of their own origin. An approval is
  bound to what was approved: the local approval record stores the exact candidate hash, projection
  identity and scope at approval time, and a pulled `approved` proposal creates or keeps a
  projection only when its candidate hash, projection and scope equal that record. Otherwise the
  local effective state is `pending` with the remote decision visible; the stored wire revision is
  unchanged and re-published as received.

## What a replica publishes

Every push writes the replica's complete knowledge, so a third replica (or a device joining after
several updates) can catch up from any one bundle: the identity fields of every revision this
replica stores, own history included (`sync_revisions` keeps every revision the replica created
or received), plus the payload of every current head that passes the filter below. Ancestors ship
as identity-only lines. A local change since the last push first creates the new revision, then
publishes it.

- Content filter, evaluated in a fixed order: (1) candidates are the payloads that pass their
  own class rule below (memory, work, sharing proposal; a source with its memory; a grant with
  its memory), (2) a context is a candidate when a candidate work or source references it or a
  candidate of its repository exists, (3) the reference closure below removes candidates until
  nothing changes, and the survivors ship. A memory's payload is shipped only when its effective sensitivity is in a
  class the consent selected (`eligible`, `local_only`, `private`; `secret` is never selectable),
  and a work's payload only when its `purpose_sensitivity` (raised by any stored floor) is in a
  selected class, whether or not the work has a checkpoint; a sharing proposal's payload only when
  its `candidate_sensitivity` (raised by any stored floor) is in a selected class, independently
  of its origin memory and work (`import promote` can attach a `private` pending candidate to an
  `eligible` memory);
  it is not live quarantined text (`review_state = 'imported'` and not tombstoned and not secret),
  and none of its sources still points at an unfinished raw event on this replica
  (`raw_events.classification_state <> 'done'` or `processing_state` not in `processed`,
  `excluded`; `legacy_unknown` counts as unfinished). A source ships exactly when its memory
  ships: sources are provenance rows, with or without retained evidence, and a purged raw event
  changes nothing. A context's payload ships only when at least one payload of its repository
  ships in the same bundle; otherwise the context ships identity-only (its `natural`
  `{repo, local_key}` carries only hashes), so `root` and `repo_secret_paths_json` stay on the
  device, and no `repo` line is emitted for a repository nothing was exported from. Migration
  receipts (`migration_records`) never ship. A foreign head's payload
  ships only when the replica still holds it (not erased) and the same filter allows it.
- Control always travels: for every origin the replica ever published, the current revision is
  shipped even when the content filter withholds the payload, as a control revision
  (`payload: null`, `tombstone`, `sensitivity_floor`). This is what carries "now secret", "now
  private" and "deleted" to replicas that already hold the text, and it is unaffected by
  `review_state` (the 0005 trigger and `worker/batches.ts` set `review_state = 'imported'` when a
  memory becomes secret).
- Reference closure: a payload whose entity reference points at a withheld origin is itself
  withheld (its identity line still goes). A work whose checkpoint chain, purpose or context
  references a withheld origin is withheld as a whole. So no bundle contains a dangling payload
  reference, and no withheld row is promoted by being referenced.
- An origin under an open `sync_conflicts` row is published with all its heads; the conflict is
  local bookkeeping.

### Repository identity

A repository key is fixed-size so it fits every `id512` reference field of the reused native
schemas while `normalized_identity` itself may be 16,384 characters: the `repo` line carries the
full identity, references carry the key. A `remote` repository with a canonical identity
(`isCanonicalRemoteIdentity`) is global: its key is `remote:<SHA-256 hex of normalized_identity>`
and every replica resolves it to the same local repository, creating it when absent exactly as
native import does. A `common_dir` identity is a path on one device, so its key is
`<replica origin_id>:common_dir:<SHA-256 hex of normalized_identity>` and it never resolves by
itself: the reader needs an explicit mapping (`oboete sync map-repo <key> <local repo id>`,
stored in `sync_repo_mappings`, 0008). Until a mapping exists, payloads referencing that repository
are stored but not applied (`withheld_on_apply`, visible in `sync status`), and they apply on the
next pull after the mapping appears. After mapping, repository ownership is verified as migration
verifies it: a memory, source, work, context or grant whose repository differs from its parent's
is rejected.

`withheld` in the header counts the payloads left out by these rules, and `oboete sync status`
shows them by reason.

## Push

0. Take the per-space lock: open `$OBOETE_HOME/sync/<space_id>.lock.db` (a one-table SQLite file)
   and hold `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on it for the whole operation. A second push or pull for the same
   space gets `SQLITE_BUSY` and exits `busy`. The operating system releases the lock when the
   process dies, so there is no stale-lock state and nothing to reclaim.
1. Recompute the consent hash; on mismatch write nothing and exit 3 with the changed fields.
   Then, on the one connection the push uses throughout, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, read
   `PRAGMA data_version` first (the baseline, D0), run the change pass, `COMMIT`. SQLite bumps
   that counter when a connection starts a transaction and finds another connection's commit
   since its previous one, never for the connection's own commits and never inside a held
   transaction, so every later reading that equals D0 proves no foreign commit landed since the
   pass's snapshot.
2. `BEGIN` a read transaction, read `PRAGMA data_version`; if it differs from D0, end it and
   restart from step 1 (a commit landed between the pass and this snapshot). Build the revision
   lines as canonical JSONL into an owner-only temporary file under `$OBOETE_HOME/sync/staging/`
   (hashing and counting as it goes; reject when header plus lines exceed 256 MiB or any line
   exceeds the transfer line limit), compute `snapshot_id`, then end the read transaction. The
   push is a candidate for "unchanged" when `snapshot_id` equals `last_pushed_snapshot_id` for
   this space **and** the published file `<space dir>/<origin_id>.osb` exists with the recorded
   ciphertext SHA-256 and size, and `--republish` was not given; a missing, shorter or different
   published file is re-published from the same snapshot (the file-sync tool may have lost or
   rolled it back).
3. Unless the push is a candidate for "unchanged", encrypt the staging file to a ciphertext file
   in the same private staging directory and `fsync` it. Nothing has touched the space directory
   yet, so a file-sync tool cannot carry a stale ciphertext: the space directory only ever
   receives bytes that passed step 4.
4. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on the database (a new snapshot plus the writer lock, so no other connection
   can commit until this step ends) and read `PRAGMA data_version` again. If the value differs
   from D0, some commit happened after the pass (the worker may have made a staged row secret or
   deleted): roll back, delete the temporary files, restart from step 1; after three restarts
   exit `busy`. If it is equal and the push is a candidate for "unchanged", end the transaction
   and stop: "unchanged", no file write (the check runs before this exit, so a secret marking or
   deletion committed during staging is never hidden behind a matching snapshot). Otherwise the
   staged bytes are exactly the current state: copy the ciphertext into the space
   directory as `<origin_id>.osb.tmp-<random>` (a rename when the staging directory is on the same
   filesystem, otherwise a streamed copy plus `fsync`), rename it over `<origin_id>.osb`, record
   step 5 in the same transaction, `COMMIT`. The writer lock is held for the copy, the rename and
   the record, not for staging or encryption (the change pass holds it for its own short
   transaction). A tool that carries the temporary name mid-copy
   carries current-state bytes that fail authentication until complete; readers ignore the name.
5. `last_pushed_snapshot_id`, the ciphertext SHA-256 and size are recorded in the step 4
   transaction after the rename returns. Any failure before that leaves the previous bundle and
   the record untouched; the temporary file is removed. Temporary files left by an interrupted
   push are ignored by readers (name pattern) and deleted by the next push of the same replica.

Push is idempotent: re-running with no local change and an intact published file rewrites nothing.

## Pull

0. Hold the same per-space lock as push.
1. Recompute the consent hash; on mismatch read nothing and exit 3.
2. `readdir` the space directory; keep only `<hex32>.osb` names other than the local origin ID; at
   most 32 replicas per space directory, more is an error naming the count and the file names
   that have no stored cursor (the user deletes bundles of replicas that no longer exist; mtime
   never ranks them, see "Fence").
3. For each bundle: `stat` size bound, check magic and key id (`key_mismatch` skips), decrypt chunk
   by chunk into a bounded owner-only plaintext staging file, and only after the final chunk
   authenticates: parse the header, verify `replica_origin_id`, `space_id`, `revision_lines`,
   `heads` and `revisions_sha256`.
4. If `snapshot_id` equals the cursor stored for that replica, skip it.
5. Validate every line in a private scratch SQLite: schema per kind, origin ID shape, recomputed
   `revision_id` and `payload_hash`, parents resolvable and of the same kind, no
   duplicate line, repo lines present for every referenced repository, no entity reference to an
   origin that is neither in the bundle nor known locally, and the graph bounds below. A bundle
   with any invalid line is rejected whole.
6. Apply in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction: first record revisions for local changes not yet
   recorded (below), then apply in two phases. Phase one resolves or allocates the local row for
   every origin in the bundle (alias by `natural`, else a new local id) and stores the revisions
   in `parents` order per origin. Phase two connects references and writes rows: source and
   checkpoint lineage edges (`source_memory_id`, `checkpoint_parent_id`) are applied parent-first
   and must be acyclic, supersession (`superseded_by`) is applied afterwards and checked
   separately, and ownership back-references (`work_id`, `current_checkpoint_memory_id`,
   `origin_context_id`) are plain lookups with no ordering role, exactly the three separate checks
   the native reader performs. A work advances (fast-forward) when the pulled head's
   `current_checkpoint_memory_id` reaches the local current checkpoint through
   `checkpoint_parent_id` links available in the bundle or already stored; a new work is created
   at the pulled head; anything else is the sibling case. Intermediate checkpoints are memories
   with their own origins and ship as heads with payloads, so a joining device rebuilds the chain
   from the current bundle alone. Then store the cursor
   `(space_id, replica_origin_id, snapshot_id)` in the same transaction. Rows created by pull keep
   the `review_state` (`unreviewed`/`reviewed`), sensitivity and origin IDs they carry (the creating
   replica already classified them) and are eligible for retrieval like local rows; a pulled row is
   never placed in quarantine and never gains local approval authority.
7. A bundle that fails at any step is reported by name and reason; the database, the cursor and the
   other bundles' outcomes are unaffected. A truncated or half-copied file simply fails
   authentication and is retried on the next pull.

Pull never writes into the space directory.

## Consent

A sync-specific consent record, separate from observer consent, binds:

```text
transport=file-bundle, directory (as given + realpath), space_id, key_id,
encryption=aes-256-gcm+hkdf-sha256 (oboete-sync-bundle/1), sensitivity classes exported,
"no network"
```

`oboete sync init|join` shows the tuple and stores its hash. Every push/pull recomputes and compares
it first; any difference (directory moved, key file replaced, class selection changed) performs no
I/O and reports the changed field. Removing the space (`oboete sync leave`) deletes the key file,
the local cursors and this replica's own `<origin_id>.osb`, and leaves the other bundles to the
user. Repository identities (hashed keys, and the plaintext `repo` line for every repository a
shipped payload references) and identity-only context and control lines leave regardless of the
class selection.

## Commands and health

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `oboete sync init <dir>` | Create space, key, consent; write nothing to `<dir>` until first push. |
| `oboete sync join <dir>` | Join; key typed on a TTY with echo off; consent. |
| `oboete sync key show` | Print the key line (TTY only). |
| `oboete sync push` / `pull` | As above. `--json` prints counts, withheld, conflicts, skipped bundles. |
| `oboete sync status` | Local-only: space, replicas seen, cursors, open conflicts, withheld counts. Conflicts, withheld origins and unmapped repositories are listed 200 at a time with the full count in `totals`. |
| `oboete sync resolve <origin_id> --keep <revision_id \| checkpoint memory origin>` | Create a successor revision with every current head as parent whose content is the kept head; for a work, `--keep` may name a stored checkpoint memory of that work instead (an observer conflict candidate that no revision points at), and the successor is the work's current payload with `current_checkpoint_memory_id` set to it; closes the conflict row. |
| `oboete sync leave` | Remove key, cursors, consent and this replica's own bundle file. |

MCP exposes `sync status` read-only. No MCP or agent path can push, pull or resolve.
`oboete doctor` reports sync as configured/unconfigured and the consent state from local data only.

## Bounds

| Bound | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Plaintext per bundle (header + all lines) | 256 MiB (268,435,456 bytes) |
| Ciphertext per bundle | 268,501,036 bytes |
| Chunk | 65,536 bytes + 16-byte tag |
| Header line | 65,536 bytes |
| Replicas per space directory (pull refuses above this) | 32 |
| Revision lines per bundle | 1,000,000 (the native line cap) |
| Repo lines per bundle | 4,096 (one line per distinct repository key; the header declares only `revision_lines`, so this bound is counted while parsing) |
| Parents per revision | 64 (equal to heads per origin, so `resolve` can always cite every head) |
| Heads per origin, and per local row after aliasing (checked inside the apply transaction) | 64 |
| Revisions per origin | 4,096 |
| Staging | one plaintext file per bundle, removed after apply or failure |
| Process RSS | import/export CLI budget from `contracts/migration.md` |

## Schema (0008, additive; designed in T034 from this contract)

`sync_spaces` (space, directory, key id, consent hash, last pushed snapshot, published file
hash/size), `sync_cursors` (space, replica, snapshot), `sync_origins` (origin_id ↔ kind, local id;
several origins may map to one local id, and the row's selected head, `materialized_hash` and
`materialized_revision` live on its canonical origin), `sync_revisions` (revision_id,
origin_id, kind, author, parents JSON, control JSON, payload_hash, payload JSON or null,
received-from replica, and for a source revision `tuple_json`, its UNIQUE tuple, see "Envelope
and lines"), `sync_repo_mappings` (repo key ↔ local repo id), and the local approval record's
candidate hash/projection/scope columns. No trigger is added to the tracked tables, and one
column (`memory_sources.sync_key`, the row's identity). Heads are derived
(`revisions with no stored child`),
not stored. `sync_conflicts` (0003) is reused as the conflict report. 0001–0007 tables are
otherwise untouched.

## Review status (T033)

Nine fresh Codex read-only contract reviews on 2026-09-11 (`/var/tmp/oboete-009-20260909.jJ5grc/
scratch/syncrev1`…`syncrev9`, prompts and verdicts) shaped this text: rounds 1–7 each found
1–3 high findings that were folded in above (payload/identity separation, control revisions,
natural-key aliasing, push staging fence and `data_version` re-check, two-phase apply, lineage
inheritance, materialized-state change capture); round 8 added the proposal class gate, the
checkpoint deletion unit and tombstones for physically deleted rows. Round 9 ran twice: Codex
(high 2, medium 3: the `data_version` baseline now spans the change pass, the "unchanged" exit
moved behind the step 4 check, `materialized_hash` excludes apply-side raises, resolutions
bypass the checkpoint chain, observer conflict rows are listed and closed) and a five-lens
adversarially verified review (`syncrev9/workflow-synthesis.json`: 42 findings, 5 survived: the
checkpoint sweep of already stored rows, per-row heads for aliased origins, identity-only
contexts, the per-origin head bound in the test list, the 32-replica error naming files). All
are folded in above. Round 10 (Codex, `syncrev10`: high 1, medium 4) found the resolution rule
matching ordinary successors and a local edit building on an unseen head; v10 restricts
resolutions to multi-parent revisions, parents local edits on `materialized_revision`, binds
cross-origin parent links only once the reader aliases the origins, bounds heads per local
row, lets `resolve` name a checkpoint memory, and fixes the filter's evaluation order. T034
closes every finding with a test in the list below.

Implementation notes (T034–T036, 2026-09-11): the text above was amended in three places while
the code was written, each recorded here rather than silently: `revisions_sha256` covers the
`repo` lines as well as the revision lines (the reader hashes every body line); `sync.key_id` is
allow-listed by the config credential guard; the fence names `src/sync/status.ts` as the one
sync module `doctor` and MCP import. The 0008 schema adds `sync_approvals` (proposal id,
candidate hash, projection hash, scope, approved at), written by every local approval.

Review rounds on the implementation (2026-09-11: a Codex read-only probe, `/code-review high`,
and the verification tests themselves) fixed the following and pinned each with a test; where
the text above says less, this paragraph is the rule:

- staging rejects a payload that is not the record its identity describes, exactly as the native
  reader does: a memory or candidate whose text does not hash to its material hash
  (`material_hash_mismatch`, `candidate_hash_mismatch`), text on a deleted or secret memory
  (`redacted_memory_text`), and a natural key the payload does not derive (`natural_mismatch`).
  Deletion is carried by the control, never by the payload alone: a payload with `deleted_at` set
  under a control that does not mark the revision a tombstone is rejected
  (`deleted_without_tombstone`), because apply reads deletion from the control, so such a line
  would otherwise skip the hash comparison and blank a row that stays alive;
  Text and candidate are identity, never edited in place, so a revision that swaps a proposal's
  candidate is malformed and its bundle is rejected before anything is stored;
- repository ownership is verified on apply with local rows, as migration verifies it: a memory,
  source, work, grant or proposal whose repository differs from its parent's, and a work pointer
  that does not name a checkpoint of that work, are withheld (`repo_mismatch` in `sync status`),
  never written; the rest of the bundle applies;
- an approval binds when the candidate hash and the projection's content hash equal the local
  record (the grant scope is fixed by the 0006 CHECK); a pulled grant binds to the row its scope
  resolves to, which may be a `v_migration:<id>` row from before sync;
- a head whose payload was never shipped or was erased by a terminal control is fully applied and
  becomes the materialized base, so the next local change is its successor;
- a pulled checkpoint's `content_hash` is `checkpointHash(repo, work, parent, material)`;
- a proposal that arrived withheld aliases onto the local equivalent once its repository is
  mapped; a source that changed a field in place is a revision of the same origin (round four;
  rounds one to three carried a content-derived source identity, since replaced);
- Pull step 7 covers every failure: an unexpected apply error is reported as
  `apply_failed:<sqlite result code | error class>` for that bundle and the others proceed;
- a push whose snapshot cannot be built or exceeds 256 MiB fails as `publish_failed` /
  `plaintext_too_large` with no file in the space directory, the staging directory empty and the
  connection outside any transaction; `init`/`join` record the directory as an absolute path;
- the per-origin revision bound counts a re-sent log once (stored plus new revisions);
- `--republish` after `map-repo` keeps `snapshot_id` when no line changed (Verification bullet
  amended).

Round two (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on the round-one fixes):

- a revision names its references (repository key, memory, work, parent) the way its natural key
  does, on every replica (`alignToNatural` in capture, materialized state and resolve): the
  natural key is frozen when the origin is created, while the canonical origin or the mapped
  repository a reference resolves to can change later, so without this a peer would reject a
  legitimate bundle as `natural_mismatch` after an alias flip or a `map-repo`. The reader derives
  the natural key from the payload with the sender's own function; a projection released to an
  ordinary row keeps its origin and is checked by its content hash alone;
- a personal projection's text must hash to its identity (`personal_identity_mismatch`) and it
  carries no work lineage (`personal_source_lineage`), as the native reader checks;
- a received source lands on the local row that shares a real UNIQUE tuple with it (NULL members
  never match, as in the index), so context-only and citation rows stay distinct; a dependency
  edge (`source_memory_id`) may name a personal projection of another repository and is not an
  ownership violation; only `source_context_id` is owned;
- a row released by `map-repo` aliases onto its local row before its control is read, so a row
  already terminal on this device keeps that state ("a later alias onto a row that is already
  terminal inherits that terminal state");
- a control revision without payload applies its floor to an existing work or proposal (purpose
  and candidate text dropped at `secret`);
- a work whose pointer names another work's checkpoint is withheld whole (`repo_mismatch`): the
  row is restored to what it was, and the closing pass records nothing for it.

Round three (2026-09-11, `/code-review high` on the round-two fixes):

- a line whose natural key is a personal projection must hash to the projection text whatever
  identity domain its payload claims (`personal_identity_mismatch`), so a successor "released"
  from a projection cannot carry other text onto the approved row;
- the late alias is a pre-pass: every origin of the pass that can bind to a local row binds
  before any row is written, then the canonical rows are materialized, so an origin that joins a
  row already written in the same pass still applies its heads and control. A source origin binds
  only to a row that exists (never to a synthesized id), and a writer that withholds leaves the
  origin unbound, so the closing pass authors no tombstone for a row that was never there;
- local changes are captured before anything binds: `map-repo` captures at the start of its
  transaction exactly as a pull and a resolve do, so a row edited since the last sync command
  carries its own revision before a released origin aliases onto it. A capture between the alias
  and the materialization would mint a revision for a change nobody made (the row then hashes
  under the canonical natural key);
- when a writer withholds, the materialized base hash is recomputed from the local row as it is,
  aligned to the canonical natural key, never carried from the previous canonical;
- a resolve that keeps the head of an aliased origin ships the successor's references aligned to
  the canonical natural key, so the peers accept it;
- a new work whose pointer is foreign but whose checkpoints arrived with it stays (its rows
  reference it) and is withheld with the written state as its base, so the closing pass records
  nothing for it;
- a source's local identity is its stored sync key (round four; round three hashed
  device-independent references on every capture, which redaction on the wire and identical
  parents still broke).

Round four (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + a `/code-review` finder on the round-three fixes):

- a source's identity is a key stored on the row at its first capture, never recomputed (see
  "Envelope and lines"): no identity churn on in-place edits, redaction or a parent's secret
  marking, no phantom origins on the receiver, and a tombstone for a source or memory this device
  never held is applied (its origin binds to the identity it would have), never left withheld;
- an alias a writer discovers (an independent capture of the same identity, a row another origin
  created earlier in the same pass) re-enters the pass: the merged group's canonical is processed
  again with the combined heads and control, and nothing is recorded on an origin that is no
  longer canonical. The pre-pass binding runs to a fixpoint, so a chain (checkpoint parents)
  resolves in any order;
- the materialized base is realigned to the canonical natural key at the start of the pass, before
  any write or trigger, and kept when a writer withholds; a floor raised through a parent during
  the pass is therefore a difference the closing capture records, never absorbed into the base;
- a row that already shows the selected head under the effective control is not written again
  (the log is re-sent with every snapshot, and a device's own row may hold more than the wire form
  of its head); a terminal control is always applied;
- when a canonical changes to an origin that only arrived (it sorts first), the local row's
  materialized base moves with it independently of the selected head, so the next local edit is
  a successor of that base.

Round five (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round four):

- a bound source origin names its row by the row's key (`local_id`), not by the key it arrived
  with, in every branch (tombstone, control-only, payload), so a tombstone reaches a row a tuple
  alias gave another key; (round five shipped the memory a source sits under as revision data;
  round six returned it to the natural key, a move being a new source, because a payload
  reference that is not pinned to the natural key changes with every alias flip of the memory);
- a received source is matched against every UNIQUE tuple of `memory_sources` it carries, with
  `=` on each member (NULL never matches, as in the index); the first match is the row it lands
  on and any other row holding one of its tuples is the row it replaces (that row's origin
  records a tombstone), so no write can violate an index and fail the bundle;
- a row under a deleted or secret memory never receives the fields the wire redacts, whatever a
  head carries;
- a source key names the owning memory by its natural key and identical rows by their ordinal,
  so keys agree across devices and never collide across repositories;
- a writer claims its row before writing: when the row already belongs to other origins the
  groups merge there, nothing is written, and the merged canonical is realigned and processed
  with the combined heads and control; a row processed again is counted once;
- an origin applied without a row (a tombstone or floor for a row this device never held) has
  no materialized base, and `map-repo` re-evaluates every origin without a row, so the mapping
  binds it to the row it resolves to and applies it.

Round six (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round five):

- a source's key is this device's naming (fields and the owning memory's local id, ordinal for
  identical rows) and the natural key names the memory again: a move is a new source plus a
  tombstone, an alias flip of the memory is not a change of its sources, and a deleted and
  re-inserted row keeps its origin (see "Envelope and lines");
- a head whose UNIQUE tuple another origin's row holds never deletes that row: when that
  origin is still to be processed in the pass (it may move or die) the head waits and is retried
  after it (`tuple_held` until then); when it is settled, an unbound head aliases onto the row
  and a bound head is withheld; a bound origin whose row is gone writes nothing and the closing
  pass records its tombstone as a successor of its last materialized revision;
- an origin that stopped being canonical during the pass is processed as its canonical, never
  written or counted; rows are counted once by local row; origins without a row that alias onto
  a row the pass created bind after it and their merged canonical is processed;
- a dependency edge is a context-only edge to another memory (`invalid_source_edge` at staging),
  and one that would close a cycle through the edges this device holds is withheld
  (`lineage_cycle`).

Round seven (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round six):

- a source's key is random, drawn at the row's first capture (round six derived it from the
  row's fields and the owning memory's local id with an ordinal, which still aliased rows across
  unmapped repositories, reused a tombstoned origin when a row moved back, and changed the
  origin of a received row on an identical re-insert): a deleted and re-inserted row is a new
  source and a move is a new source, and sameness across devices comes only from the UNIQUE
  tuples (see "Envelope and lines");
- the tuple wait (`tuple_held`) is gone: before the pass, a bound source head that leaves its
  row's UNIQUE tuple, or that is a tombstone, parks its row (deleted, kept aside), so heads that
  exchange tuples in one pass both land and nothing waits on anything; a head whose tuple a row
  of another origin holds aliases there (an unbound origin binds to the row, a bound one moves
  with its group onto it) and the merged group's heads decide; a parked row whose head was not
  written back (withheld, or moved by a merge) is restored as it was;
- a tombstone or floor for a source row this device never held applies without binding: no
  local id, no materialized base, no row counted, so the origin still binds late to a row
  created afterwards with its tuple;
- every origin without a row is re-evaluated at the start of a pass and after every sweep, to
  a fixpoint (a row the pass creates may be the one it aliases onto), whatever its withheld
  reason; `map-repo` re-applies the withheld origins and leaves the binding to the pass;
- the cycle check walks reachable memories once each (no depth cutoff), so it terminates on a
  store that already holds a cycle and finds a cycle however long the way round;
- `resolve` reports a kept head its writer cannot apply as a coded failure (the writer's
  withheld reason, or `merged`) instead of a stack trace, and the staged reference closure
  includes the memory a source's natural key names.

Round eight (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round seven; sixteen
findings, all in the random key and the parking of round seven):

- a source's key is the hash of its wire fields and its memory's material again, with an ordinal
  for identical duplicates (round seven's random key made every observer rewrite of a flat
  provenance row a tombstone plus a new origin, and let a deletion for a row this device never
  held depend on the pull order), and a source's deletion is a state a later revision of the row
  revives, not a final control (round seven had to mint a new origin for every re-creation
  because the tombstone was final; the re-creation now names the retired tombstones as parents,
  so it supersedes them wherever both arrive); sameness is carried too: an origin keeps the
  tuple of its last payload, a terminal head line ships it, and a lineage link to a bound
  origin binds (see "Envelope and lines", "Merge rules");
- the pass parks only a source row whose head it can evaluate now (references resolve, no
  cycle through the edges it holds, the parked rows' edges included); a row whose fate it
  cannot decide stays, and a head that wants its tuple waits on it (`tuple_held`, withheld after
  the pass, re-evaluated by the next pull) instead of merging with a row that may still move;
- a head whose tuples several rows of other origins hold joins them into one row (every holder's
  origins move onto the first, the extra rows are dropped) instead of moving between them; a
  bound origin that joins another row drops its own;
- a parked row whose head was withheld after all comes back through the same rules as a head:
  under the redaction its memory now implies, and, when another head took one of its tuples in
  the pass, by joining that row rather than by an insert the index would refuse;
- the siblings of a source resolve at once to the selected head, so a source never stays in
  conflict and the alias travels; `resolve` of a source runs the pass, so a kept head that takes
  another row's tuple merges the rows instead of failing as `merged`;
- late binding runs to a fixpoint before the pass and again only after a sweep created rows;
  a withheld reason is cleared for every origin of an applied group.

Round nine (2026-09-11, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round eight; twenty
findings, the closure of round eight's sameness rules):

- the alias by key is per memory in the writer too: a tombstone of an origin that has no row
  here deletes nothing, and a parked row of another memory under the same key is neither dropped
  nor taken (an unbound origin whose key another memory's row holds lands under a key of its
  own); the key walk at capture skips a key whose origin names another memory or moved onto
  another row, and a key a pass set aside;
- a re-creation names every retired tombstone at the frontier of the tuple's groups (not only a
  childless one), and unions their groups, so a chain of re-creations converges on a new peer;
- the tuple travels per revision (`sync_revisions.tuple_json`, inherited by a control revision
  from its parent, kept on erase): a stale snapshot pulled back cannot rewind the tuple a later
  deletion carries;
- a head cannot be evaluated when its row's selected head is withheld or carries no payload
  (withheld on the wire or erased), whether or not that row is in the pass: `resolve` of a head
  that wants such a row's tuple is refused with `tuple_held` and moves nothing; a terminal tuple
  reaches every local row holding a part of it (the holders join first);
- lineage joins two source origins already bound to two rows (the rows join on the row of the
  canonical that sorts first), and the join runs once every line of the bundle is stored,
  whichever origin's lines came first;
- a source's heads select by revision id alone, the same on every device, and sibling heads with
  the same payload hash and control are equivalent (no resolution is recorded), so concurrent
  automatic resolutions converge and a change-free exchange stops growing the log;
- a revival inserted by an origin already bound re-runs late binding (a tombstone that waited
  for the row binds and is resolved in the same pass), and a revival whose payload is withheld
  is not answered with a sibling tombstone;
- a parked row whose tuple another head took while its own head waited is set aside
  (`sync_parked`, as it was) instead of merged into the taker: its own head says where it goes,
  the log never made the two the same source, and the capture does not read the absence as a
  deletion; the next pass parks it again, retries its head, and puts it back once its tuple is
  free (the round-eight restore-merge is gone);
- a store bound reached by a local capture under the space lock (`revisions_per_origin`) is a
  `SyncError`, not a crash.

Round ten (2026-09-12, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round nine; twelve
findings, the closure of round nine):

- a source revision keeps a tuple only from its own payload, or, for a control-only revision
  (`payload_hash` null), its first parent's; a revision whose payload is withheld on the wire
  (`payload_hash` set, payload null) waits for the payload and takes its tuple when the payload
  is filled (`storePayload` writes `tuple_json`), so a later deletion never names a stale tuple;
- a parent link joins two source groups only where both memories resolve to one local row (two
  repositories a device keeps apart stay apart, and the link is read again if the mapping
  changes); the join runs after every line of the bundle is stored;
- a source head with no payload, and a source tombstone, name their row only through a bound
  origin: an unbound origin whose key a row of another memory holds claims nothing;
- a terminal source head reaches every local row holding a part of its tuple (a post-pass sweep
  joins the holders into the terminal origin, whatever order the heads were written in, and a
  bound origin's own row absorbs them); a holder the pass cannot evaluate makes the deletion
  wait (`tuple_held`); when the holder later moves away, the deletion applies to nothing and
  stops waiting;
- a resolution carries the tuple of the head it keeps, not of its first parent (`resolveRow`
  and the automatic sibling resolution pass it through);
- a re-creation rebinds every retired group's origins onto the row before it unions them, and
  re-reads the canonical the union produced before recording its revision, so the groups stay
  one and the next unchanged capture records no phantom sibling; a move onto a retired tuple
  names the retirement too;
- the transient park a pass makes to let heads exchange tuples is held only for the pass and
  restored before it returns (no state persists between pulls): a head whose tuple a parked row
  whose own head is blocked holds waits, so nothing is merged into a taker or read as a deletion.

Round eleven (2026-09-12, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round ten; four
findings, three fixed and pinned, the fourth mitigated):

- a move onto a retired tuple names the row's own previous head as a parent, not only the
  tombstone it revives, so the peer converges (capture);
- a source tombstone that is bound but rowless from an earlier pull reaches a matching row a
  later bundle brings, through a post-pass sweep that also scans the stored terminal groups, not
  only this bundle's;
- a terminal deletion whose dependency member cannot resolve still reaches a row that shares its
  raw-event UNIQUE member (the unresolved member drops out of the match, the others stay);
- a source's restore never merges a parked row into a holder of the row's old tuple (the head
  moved it away, so they are not the same source): the origins wait and the revision
  re-materializes at its own target once its head can land, and the pass now processes sources
  content-key-first, which orders the ordinary cases. Not resolved: the cycle-break itself is
  still decided incrementally, when a head would close a cycle against the edges already applied,
  so which edge is dropped depends on which head lands first. When a single device physically
  holds a mutual cross-memory context-citation cycle (an uncommon observer state; capture writes
  the cyclic edge with no cycle guard), two devices can break the cycle at different edges and
  diverge — measured on ~60 % of runs of the adverse fixture, so it is a coin-flip once the
  cyclic state exists, not a rare order. Deterministic resolution needs a canonical break-edge
  choice independent of processing order, or capture and apply to withhold cyclic edges
  symmetrically — a design change tracked as a follow-up (issue #196), not closed by round eleven.

Round twelve (2026-09-12, Codex correctness pass + `/code-review high` on round eleven; three
findings):

- `storePayload` backfills a control-only descendant's inherited-null tuple when the parent's
  payload arrives, but the traversal matched any payload-withheld source child, so a move-revision
  (payload_hash set, its own payload still withheld) was stamped with its parent's old tuple and
  could not recover its own tuple; the traversal now matches only control-only descendants
  (`payload_hash IS NULL`), as `storeRevision`'s inheritance already does (fixed, pinned);
- two narrower source-identity edges are tracked as a follow-up (issue #197), not closed here: a
  capture that moves onto a retired tuple can, at the 64-parent bound, silently drop a required
  retirement head (63+ concurrent same-tuple tombstones — a full fix needs bounded intermediate
  merge revisions); and the stored-terminal sweep scans only bound canonicals, so an unbound
  cross-memory-key tombstone does not reach a matching source a later bundle brings.

Round thirteen (2026-09-12, PR bot triage — CodeRabbit, Greptile and the Codex connector on the
pushed head; a bundle from an in-space peer is untrusted input. Eight adversarial-hardening
findings on `src/sync/`, all fixed; three re-surfaced convergence findings are the residuals
already tracked as #196/#197):

- a repo line never binds a machine-local (`common_dir`) repository: `applyRepoLines` validates the
  key's hash against its normalized identity and records the key with no local repository, where it
  used to resolve one by identity (apply, pinned). This bounds the repo line, not the peer — see
  "Machine-local repository keys are not a boundary" below;
- `resolve --keep` refuses a head whose payload the publisher withheld (hash present, payload null):
  the successor would carry null content, so peers that hold the content recapture it and the
  resolution does not converge (apply, pinned);
- the stage pass rejects a bundle that reuses a stored origin id with a different natural key: an
  origin's natural is its immutable identity, and a rebind would write a new payload onto the old
  local row without updating its material/content identity (stage, pinned);
- `repo` lines carry their own 4,096-line cap, so a bundle cannot fill the plaintext with repo
  records that no bound counts. A shared counter would have been wrong: the header schema admits
  `revision_lines` up to exactly 1,000,000, so counting repo lines against that cap would reject a
  bundle the header declares legal (stage, pinned in both directions — at the cap and over it);
- the key file is verified against the consented key id before any bundle I/O, so a key swapped for
  another syntactically valid key never encrypts an unreadable push or rejects every peer
  (space, pinned);
- `init`/`join` write the space row and the config file together and remove the key on failure, so
  a failed config write never leaves a `sync_spaces` row that `leave` cannot reach and
  `assertNoSpace` keeps blocking (space, pinned);
- `leave` runs under the space lock, so a concurrent push cannot delete-then-republish this
  replica's bundle around it (space, pinned);
- context promotion repeats `passesClassRule`'s fail-closed guard, so a secret-floored or
  tombstoned context is never shipped even when a shipped payload references it (publish;
  defense-in-depth — the state does not arise from the honest path today).
- `publish` refuses a snapshot naming more than `BOUNDS.repoLines` repositories
  (`too_many_repo_lines`) rather than encrypting a bundle every peer would reject with
  `repo_lines_exceeded`: a bound the receiver enforces is enforced by the sender too (publish,
  pinned);
- `init`/`join` roll the space row back and remove the key when recording the space fails at any
  step, and remove the `[sync]` section only when this invocation is the one that wrote it. A row
  without the config wedges the space — `leave` reads the config and cannot reach it while
  `assertNoSpace` keeps blocking re-init — so that state is never produced; a config without the row
  is the recoverable direction (`init` reports `space_exists`, `leave` clears it). The config-write
  failure is pinned, and so is the `init` race: see round fourteen, which corrected the compensating
  delete this round introduced;
- a header rejection closes the bundle it opened. Everything before `validateBody` runs while the
  line reader is suspended at its `yield`, and a suspended generator never runs its `finally`, so
  the seven header rejections leaked a descriptor each — and `pull` walks up to
  `BOUNDS.replicasPerSpace` bundles catching every rejection (stage, pinned by descriptor count);
- `leave` removes the row and the `[sync]` section last, after the idempotent file removals, so a
  failure part-way leaves a state `leave` can simply be run over again (space, pinned). Round
  fourteen corrected the order this round introduced: the two are no longer written in one
  transaction;
- the singleton check runs again inside `recordSpace`'s write transaction: two `init`/`join`
  processes can both pass the check at the command's start, and their distinct `space_id` primary
  keys would let both rows commit while the config names one (space, pinned in round fourteen);
- the post-push sweep of this replica's leftover temporary names never turns a published bundle into
  a reported failure: every device may write the space directory and the replica id is public in the
  bundle names, so a peer can plant an entry under that prefix that will not remove (space, pinned);
- the apply pass streams the staged origins in dependency order out of the scratch table instead of
  reading them all and sorting in memory: the disk-backed staging exists so a near-limit bundle's
  hundreds of thousands of origins never have to be held at once (apply/stage);
- `sync status` lists at most 200 open conflicts, withheld origins and unmapped repositories and
  reports the true count of each in `totals`: one pull can leave very many origins withheld or
  unmapped, and the CLI and the MCP tool would otherwise materialize and serialize the whole set
  (status/CLI, pinned);
- `init` and `join` print the consent tuple the space just recorded the hash of — directory and
  realpath, space, key id, encryption, the sensitivity classes exported, "no network" — as the
  Consent section above already required. Without `--classes` the default selection includes
  `private`, so the report is the only place the developer sees what a push will export before the
  first push writes anything (CLI, pinned in JSON and text form);
- `sync key show` verifies the key file too, so a swapped key is never carried to the next device,
  and the CLI names the condition instead of printing the bare code (space/CLI, pinned);
- Not closed here (added to #197): even with the hash validated, a peer can still author a revision
  whose payload names the recipient's own correct `common_dir` key (learnable from the recipient's
  published repo lines), so it lands in the recipient's local repository; distinguishing a peer's
  edge from the owner's needs the revision's repo key to match its author's prefix or an explicit
  map-repo.

Round fourteen (2026-09-12, PR bot triage on the round-thirteen head — CodeRabbit and the Codex
connector. Two of the five findings are regressions round thirteen introduced, both in the same
compensating-write design: a rollback that undoes a write another process made):

- the compensating `delete root.sync` in `recordSpace` fires only when this invocation wrote the
  config. The loser of an `init` race fails the in-transaction `assertNoSpace` before writing
  anything, and deleting the section there deleted the *winner's* config, leaving the winner's row
  and key with no config naming them — the one state the compensation exists to prevent (space,
  pinned: the winner's `init` is run from the loser's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`);
- `leave` commits the row deletions first and writes the config after, never both in one
  transaction. Inside one, a `COMMIT` that failed after the config was already deleted rolled the
  row back under a config that was gone — again a space `leave` cannot reach. The order that
  remains can only stop with the config naming a space whose rows are gone, which the next `leave`
  walks to the end (space, pinned: the existing config-write-failure test now asserts the row is
  already gone);
- `applyRepoLines` resolves a `remote:` key only for a canonical remote identity, and only against
  a repository this device already calls remote. `repos.normalized_identity` is unique across both identity kinds, so a peer that learned
  this device's `common_dir` path could send it under a `remote:` key: the hash checks out, the
  `INSERT OR IGNORE` collides with the local row, and the unqualified lookup handed the forged key
  that local repository — the same auto-mapping the `common_dir` prefix check refuses, reached by
  the other branch. A repo line whose declared `identity_kind` disagrees with its own key prefix is
  rejected outright, since the mapping row records the declared kind while the branches read the
  prefix (apply, both pinned). Qualifying the lookup is not sufficient on its own, and a follow-up
  review pass found the rest: where the device does *not* yet hold that identity, the peer's line
  creates the row. `repos.id` is the first 16 hex of `sha256(normalized_identity)`, the same value
  `repo-identity.ts` computes, so the planted row carries the id the device will compute when the
  developer next opens that path — `storeRows` adopts it by id (its upsert rewrites only
  `display_root` and `last_seen_at`) and the forged key is already mapped to it. `repoKeyFor` mints
  a `remote:` key only for a canonical remote identity, so `applyRepoLines` now requires one, which
  refuses the plant and costs an honest peer nothing. The one canonical form that is still a path —
  a `file://` remote normalizes to a bare path — is recorded and left unmapped rather than
  rejected, since an honest device with such a remote would otherwise have its whole bundle refused
  by every peer (apply, pinned);
- every repo key is checked against the identity it declares, whichever replica minted it, not only
  the two forms this device can resolve: an unmapped key's identity is what `status` shows and what
  `map-repo` is run on the strength of (apply, pinned);
- `registerLocalRepos` records the mapping's `identity_kind` from the key it just built rather than
  from the `repos` row. `repoKeyFor` falls back to a `common_dir` key for a `remote` row whose
  identity is not canonical, and a mapping that published a `common_dir` key declaring `remote`
  would be a line every peer running the kind/prefix check rejects — taking this device's whole
  bundle with it, permanently (store, pinned);
- `--classes` is refused everywhere but `init`/`join`, and `--republish` everywhere but `push`.
  Classes are consent-bound: they are recorded once and the consent hash is taken over them, so a
  push that accepted the flag and exported the recorded set would ship exactly what the developer
  typed the flag to withhold. Silently ignoring a flag is the failure mode; exiting 2 is not.
  `key show --json` is refused for the same reason with a sharper edge: the command prints the key
  line itself, which is not JSON and is meant to be read off a terminal and carried by hand, never
  handed to something that asked for a parseable stream (sync-cli, both pinned);
- **Machine-local repository keys are not a boundary.** Three passes over `applyRepoLines` in this
  round each closed a way to bind one and each exposed the next, which is the signal that the
  premise was wrong rather than the code. What is true: a peer knows this replica's id (a bundle is
  named for it) and this device's machine-local paths, because `publish` emits both in this device's
  own repo lines. It can therefore author a revision naming `${replica}:common_dir:${sha256(path)}`.
  `applyRepoLines` records that key unmapped, but `registerLocalRepos` binds the same key to the
  real row the moment the developer opens that path, and `stage` accepts a reference to any key
  already mapped — with or without a repo line. Rejecting the line does not close it either: the
  bundle stays in the shared directory, and the next pull after the path is opened takes the mapped
  path instead. So a peer inside the space can attach a memory to a machine-local repository of this
  device without `map-repo`, and **the space key is what bounds that, not this pass**. Gating the
  binding on consent — withhold such an origin with its own reason, show it in `status`, bind on an
  explicit accept — is issue #205, deliberately not attempted mid-round: it touches the withholding
  semantics that took nine rounds to settle. What the three passes did close is real and pinned: a
  `remote:` line can no longer create a `repos` row under the id this device will later compute for
  a path, and no key may misstate the identity it displays;
- streaming the publish side's origins the way the apply side now streams them is tracked as a
  follow-up (issue #204), not closed here: `buildSnapshot`'s in-memory maps are the shape to
  change, the data is this device's own rather than peer-supplied, and the 1,000,000-line RSS
  measurement in "Verification" covers stage and apply only.


## Verification (T034–T036)

`test/unit/sync.test.ts` with three isolated homes and one shared temporary directory:

- canonical `revision_id`/`snapshot_id` (parent order, member order, control, null payload);
- push idempotence (unchanged snapshot with an intact file writes nothing; a lost or rolled-back
  published file is re-published; rewritten bundle has a new salt, same ID);
- pull of duplicate, descendant, tombstone-over-live, live-after-tombstone (conflict, no
  resurrection), sibling (both heads on both sides), resolve creating a successor; a local edit
  after a sibling arrived keeps the sibling;
- relay: A and B produce siblings, C pulls only B's bundle after B pulled A: C sees both heads and
  the same conflict; A→B→C equals A→C for every scenario here; a device joining after A pushed
  r0 then r1 (only r1's payload in the file) stores r0 as identity-only and r1 as head;
- partial descent: heads {a, b}, a1 with parent a arrives: heads become {a1, b}, the conflict
  stays open, the selected head moves only if a was selected;
- foreign edit: B edits, deletes and marks secret a memory A created; B's successors reach A and
  C; A's stored copy of the text is erased after the secret floor and never re-published by A, B
  or C;
- push race: a commit by a second connection during staging, and one between the end of staging
  and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, each make `data_version` differ and the push restart; the bundle never
  contains the row the concurrent commit made secret; a commit attempted during step 4 waits;
- delivery identity: widening the consent classes and a payload newly held change `snapshot_id`;
  `--republish` after `map-repo` rewrites the file under a new salt with the same `snapshot_id`
  when no line changed (a mapping changes how this replica reads, not what it publishes); a pull that brings a payload for a known null-payload
  revision fills it in unless the origin has a secret floor or tombstone;
- checkpoint resolve: work forks C1/C2 from C0, C1 selected, `resolve --keep` C2: selected head,
  `current_checkpoint_memory_id` and the conflict row change together and no new conflict opens;
  a bundle listing C2 before C1 still advances C0 to C2 without a conflict; a resolution R that
  keeps C2 reaches a device on the C1 branch (and a third device that receives only R's
  single-parent successor with payload): head, `current_checkpoint_memory_id` and the conflict
  row change together; a resolution that misses a head the receiver holds stays a sibling;
- natural-key alias: two devices capture identical material under different origins; pull maps
  the second origin to the existing row (no UNIQUE failure); a tombstone under either origin
  deletes the row on both devices; A deletes or marks secret before B ever saw A's origin, and
  B's copy still aliases through `natural` and follows; a repository identity of 16,384
  characters round-trips through its hashed key; divergent edits across aliases (A pins and B
  retires the same aliased row): each device shows one conflict naming all heads with their
  origins, and a single `resolve` on either origin leaves both devices with the same payload,
  no open conflict and no stale `materialized_hash`;
- change-free round trip: A pushes, B pulls and pushes, A pulls: no new revision anywhere; a
  deletion committed while a push was staging reaches the other device on the retried push; a
  secret marking or deletion committed between the change pass and step 2, and one committed
  during staging of a push that would otherwise be "unchanged", each restart the push and ship
  their control revision; the late-child raise (below) reaches a third device as a control
  revision, not only the local row;
- checkpoint order: a bundle whose lines list C2, C1, C0 in that order fast-forwards a work at C0
  to C2; a joining device rebuilds the chain from heads alone;
- work purpose: a `private` purpose with `private` unselected withholds the whole work, checkpoint
  or not, and its control revision still ships;
- change pass: A completes a work and pulls before pushing; B's descendant of the older head
  arrives as a sibling of A's completion, not as its replacement; a pull whose apply raised a
  descendant through the 0005 trigger records that raise before commit and the next push ships
  it (three devices: B holds D under P, C captured the same D independently, A marks P secret);
- late child: after B applied P's secret floor, C's new D with `source_memory_id = P` arrives:
  D is stored secret without text on B;
- proposal class: a `private` pending candidate on an `eligible` memory and work is withheld
  when `private` is unselected; its control revision ships;
- checkpoint deletion: C0 (material X) of a work is deleted on A; C2 with the same material and
  a different parent arrives from B: it is applied deleted; reverse order: B already stores C2
  when A's tombstone for C0 arrives: C2 is deleted on B and B's next push ships its tombstone; a
  third device that pulls B before A ends with C2 deleted too;
- physical deletion: a source row deleted by the worker and a grant revoked by adoption ship as
  tombstones on the next push; a pulled approval held `pending` on a device without the approval
  record does not become a new revision on that device's next push;
- alias after mapping: A and B share a `common_dir` repository at different paths; after
  `map-repo`, A's tombstone or secret floor for material B captured independently aliases through
  `natural` (material hash and mapped repository) and applies; a personal projection aliases
  across repositories;
- staging fence: the space directory receives no file before the step 4 check passes, even with a
  concurrent secret-marking commit during encryption;
- 64 sibling heads are accepted and one `resolve` closes them; an origin with 65 heads is
  rejected; two aliased origins with 33 heads each are rejected as one row of 66;
- identity-only head: A creates the first `private` checkpoint C1 of a work while B has `private`
  unselected; B receives the work revision W1 identity-only, then completes the work: B's
  revision is a sibling of W1 (parent: the last materialized revision), both devices report the
  conflict, and C1 is still selected on A; the relay case with an identity-only resolution R
  followed by a payload-carrying successor S still converges;
- observer candidate: an observer checkpoint conflict (C1 current, C2 stored as a candidate)
  that predates sync is resolved with `resolve <work origin> --keep <C2 origin>`: the work's
  pointer moves to C2 and both conflict rows close;
- mapped alias: A and B hold the same repository under different `common_dir` keys; after
  `map-repo` on B, a `resolve` whose parents span both origins' heads validates and applies on
  B, and on a third device only after it maps the repository too (until then each origin keeps
  its own heads);
- work-only repository: a repository with an `eligible` work, its context and no memories ships
  both work and context payloads; a bundle from a store of 2,000 single-head origins is accepted; open observer
  conflict rows that predate the first sync are listed by `sync status` and closed by the
  `resolve` of their work row;
- context payloads: a repository whose memories are all withheld ships its contexts identity-only
  and no `repo` line; the first shipped memory of that repository brings the context payload and
  the `repo` line;
- pull crash: a process killed after rows were updated and before the cursor was recorded leaves
  the database at the previous state (single transaction) and the next pull re-applies the bundle;
- lock: two pushes for one space, one gets `busy`; a push killed mid-way leaves no lock behind;
- sources: a re-inserted identical source keeps its origin (revived when a capture saw it gone); a removed source ships a tombstone; a
  memory with a source whose raw event is `classification_state = 'done'` and
  `processing_state = 'waiting'` is withheld with its sources and the works that reference it; a
  summary whose raw event was purged ships with its evidence-less source rows;
- repository keys: two devices with the same `common_dir` path do not merge; a mapped key applies
  the withheld payloads on the next pull;
- graph bounds: a bundle over any bound in "Bounds" is rejected before apply; validation time and
  RSS are measured on a 1,000,000-line chain, a wide fan-out and a repeated merge DAG;
- secret after sync: A publishes an `eligible` memory, B pulls it, A marks it secret (which also
  sets `review_state = 'imported'`), A pushes, B pulls: B's copy loses its text and becomes secret;
  same for `eligible` → `private` with `private` unselected on A: B raises without new text;
- approval binding: A approves candidate C0, B pulls the approval and, holding a record for C0,
  keeps the projection; a device without the record holds the decision `pending`, re-publishes
  A's revision verbatim and adds no revision of its own; an approval whose projection differs
  from the record does not bind; A's later revision that swaps the candidate for C1 contradicts
  the origin's natural key and its bundle is rejected at staging (`natural_mismatch`), so B's
  approval stays bound to C0;
- withheld closure: unprocessed sources, live quarantined memories, unselected classes, and the
  works that reference them are absent as payloads, present as control revisions where they were
  ever published, and counted; no dangling reference in any bundle;
- interrupted push (temporary file left behind is ignored), truncated and tampered bundles (every
  chunk position, tag, counter, final marker, a full-size final chunk), wrong key id, oversize
  file, foreign file names, a shipped payload whose hash differs from `payload_hash`, a line
  whose parent names a revision of another kind;
- bounds: a push at 256 MiB total plaintext round-trips; one byte more is rejected before writing;
  a bundle one byte over the ciphertext bound is rejected by `stat`;
- consent drift performs no I/O; no destination performs no I/O; `doctor` and MCP never open the
  space directory;
- schema: 0008 is additive and does not touch 0001–0007 tables except `sync_conflicts` rows.

Real multi-device use over a file-sync tool is a separate activation and is recorded as such.
