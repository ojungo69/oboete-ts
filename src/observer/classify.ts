  // historical attempt cannot keep a successfully recovered session degraded forever.

  // Each source carries its own receipt, and the batch it was taken out of may have gone on to apply
  // without a reason of its own: when some sources of a batch fail detection, come back unaccounted
  // for or have their observation dropped while the rest summarize, the batch's `degraded_reason` is
  // NULL and only the receipt says so. Reading the batch alone would hide every one of those behind
  // the held-source default this function's caller applies.
  //
  // `SUMMARY_SOURCE_SQL` gates the receipt only, not the batch. A receipt is that row's own verdict,
  // so a row the summary never treated as a source must not label the summary — without this a
  // partial prompt row, which `revalidateSources` re-reads and defers by name, would blame the
  // summarizer for text it was never sent. `degraded_reason` is the opposite: it describes the
  // attempt, not the row, so a batch that really failed still has to be reported even when every
  // row it left behind is one the summary would not have quoted.
  //
  // Every receipt tied on the newest `recorded_at`, not one of them. Two passes in the same
  // millisecond leave two, and reading both is the fail-closed side of that tie: the severer verdict
  // wins rather than whichever row sorts last. It is not free — a source re-batched in the same
  // millisecond still reports the failed batch it just left, which is the invariant above bending —
  // but the other direction loses a real failure, and `receipts tied on the same millisecond are all
  // read` is what holds the choice in place. `oboete why` and `replay-evaluate.ts` both pick exactly
  // one instead, so the readers can name different receipts for the same source under a tie (#289).
  //
  // The subquery is correlated on `r.id` alone. A receipt on another session's batch would be picked
  // and then dropped by the outer `b.session_id`, losing the source's degradation — unreachable,
  // because `raw_events.session_id` is never updated and cohorts are selected per session.
