/**
 * A stand-in for the agent command line tool: each spawn answers with the next text wrapped the
 * way the real CLI wraps it. Shared by the observer unit tests and the chain's worker tests so both
 * see the same child process shape.
 *
 * One more spawn than there are texts is answered as a failed child rather than by throwing: an
 * `assert` inside a stream handler is an asynchronous throw whose delivery is Node-version
 * dependent, and on Node 22 it stalled a worker pass instead of reporting anything. The overflow
 * therefore comes back through `runChild`'s own `process_failed`, and `calls()` is what a test
 * asserts the count on.
 *
 * Only the agent command line tool is faked. A worker pass also spawns `git` for citations, and
 * answering that with a scripted CLI reply (or failing it as unexpected) stalls the pass instead of
 * reporting anything, so every other command is handed to the real `spawn`.
