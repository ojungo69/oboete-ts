/**
 * The `claude-to-codex` pair of the 2026-09-17T15-05-08-894Z dogfood run (JST 2026-09-18), as it
 * stood when the receiving prompt pack was built: five memories, of which the two session summaries
 * are out of the search scope but still in the FTS index. It is the reproduction of #275 — the pack
 * dropped `m_fact`, which carries the three facts the recall prompt asks for, as `below_threshold`
 * while keeping `m_confirm`, which carries none of them. The run's copy of that pair's database,
 * `/var/tmp/oboete-dogfood-upgrade/all0917/claude-to-codex/memory.db`, is the receipt for the rows.
 *
 * Keep all five rows. The miss still reproduces on the three searchable ones, but removing the
 * summaries takes the corpus from five documents to three, which lifts `m_decision` above the
 * threshold and changes what comes back — measuring a fix against a corpus the run never had.
 *
 * The prompts and facts below track what `scripts/e2e/probe-lib/isolated-agent.mjs` builds, and are
 * not taken on trust: `the pinned pair prompts are still the ones the probe library sends` compares
 * all three against that library's own output.

/**
 * Named the way `scripts/e2e/isolated-user.mjs` names it. Because it is a live call, a change to
 * `factStem` rewrites this stem and with it `PAIR_FACTS`, `m_fact`'s body and `m_request`'s title
 * and body — the corpus this file exists to freeze. What stops that from happening silently is the
 * seeding prompt below, which spells the stem out: the two disagree and
 * `the pinned pair prompts are still the ones the probe library sends` fails. Read a failure there
 * as "the stem moved", not only as "the prompt text moved".
